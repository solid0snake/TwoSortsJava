# Two Sorts Java
<h6>
Graphically shows the difference between insertion sort and selection sort. (Applet) <br>
The applet displays bars of various heights, corresponding to the integer values in two arrays. It displays the bars after each "pass" of the sorting algorithms. The passes on the arrays are controlled by a button. Each time the button is pressed one element in each array is sorted and then the bars are displayed. The blue bars use the selection sort and the green bars use the insertion sort.
